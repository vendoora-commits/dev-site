## Testing Contact Form

After deployment, test the contact form:

1. Visit your deployed site
2. Go to the Contact page
3. Fill out and submit the form
4. Check that you receive the email at `vendoora2025@gmail.com`

## Security Notes

- ‚úÖ Environment variables are encrypted in Vercel
- ‚úÖ Never commit real passwords to git
- ‚úÖ Use App Passwords instead of main account passwords
- ‚úÖ Rotate passwords regularly

## Troubleshooting

### Contact Form Not Working

1. **Check Environment Variables**: Ensure `EMAIL_USER` and `EMAIL_PASS` are set in Vercel
2. **Verify App Password**: Make sure you're using a Gmail App Password, not your regular password
3. **Check Vercel Logs**: View deployment logs for any errors
4. **Test Locally**: Set up `.env.local` for local testing

### Local Development Setup

Create `.env.local` for local testing:

```bash
# .env.local (DO NOT COMMIT TO GIT)
EMAIL_USER=vendoora2025@gmail.com
EMAIL_PASS=your_gmail_app_password_here
```
